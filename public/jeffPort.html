It was a platform for providing products and services offers using various relevancy engines and harnessing Barclays’ extensive consumer database. It consisted of a consumer e-commerce application, a self-serve merchant site, and administra</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D">tive sites for managing merchants and customers. </SPAN></P><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="line-height:14px"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#5A5B5D">My role: </SPAN></H5><P style="line-height:14px"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D">I was a Front End Developer on an agile development team, but I wore many hats for this position: Designer, Front End coder, Ruby and JS programmer, and of course QA analyst. </SPAN></P><P style="line-height:14px"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D">I employed the use of a stack of tools from Adobe CS6 to HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and on into backend technolo</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D">gies like Ruby on Rails, rspec and cucumber for testing. </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="line-height:14px"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#5A5B5D">As a Designer... </SPAN></H5><P style="margin-bottom:55px; line-height:14px"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#5A5B5D">Designs from vendor firms invariably required modifications and often didn’t account for many screensize breakpoints.

All of these different features had to be accounted for in limited real estate, and it of course had to be mobile responsive.
